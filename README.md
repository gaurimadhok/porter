# Porter is a Cloud Installer

Porter gives you the building blocks to create a cloud installer for your
application, handling all the necessary infrastructure and configuration setup.
It is based on the Cloud Native Application Bundle Specification
([CNAB](https://deislabs.io/cnab)). Porter provides a declarative authoring
experience that lets you focus on what you know best: your application.

# Roadmap

Porter is an open-source project and things get done as quickly as we have
motivated contributors working on features that interest them. ðŸ˜‰

We use a single [project board][board] across all of our repositories to track
open issues and pull requests.

The roadmap represents what the core maintainers have said that they are
currently working on and plan to work on over the next few months. We use the
"on-hold" bucket to communicate items of interest that doesn't have a core
maintainer who will be working on it.
